## Zero-based Envelope Budget

### Goal

- Build a digital tool for people who want to setup a zero-based envelope budget 

### Plan

- Build an interface that allows a user to input their monthly income  

- UI will allow user to input an amount in each envelope 

- UI will display the amount of income remaining  

- User can customize the name of each envelope  

- User can customize each envelopeâ€™s amount 

- Default number of 10 envelopes 

- UI will be responsive 

 

### Bonus

- I want to the user to be able to add/remove as many envelopes as needed  

- Require a minimum of 1 envelope 

- UI displays the denominations of bills needed for envelopes 

 

### Languages
